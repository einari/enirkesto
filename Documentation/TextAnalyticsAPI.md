# Text Analytics API

When the host is running (read more [here](GettingStarted.md)), the APIs are accessible through `http://localhost:3000` and the route to the API.

For details on how the implementation can be augmented for accuracy with additional stemmer dictionary and stopwords go [here](Stemmer.md) and [here](Stopwords.md).
